In client mode, using 3000 mAh LiPo battery, the Wireless tracker lasted about 32 hours.

In tracker mode, using power saving suggestions on Heltec forums, battery percentage seems to be decreasing somewhat less than 1 percent per hour. So far it has been running for 34 hours and has decreased from 93 to 73 percent battery. This would imply a battery cycle lenght of somewhere in the ballpark of 6 to 7 days (conservatively estimate 5 days).

Even if the battery is used to power other devices/peripherals it seems like a 24 hour lifespan is easily feasible; obviously more would be possible with a bigger battery and/or solar panels to top-off the battery.
